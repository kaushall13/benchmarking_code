# **Development Approach & Technical Decisions**

This document outlines the philosophy and technical decisions made during the development of the Local LLM Performance & Benchmarking Suite. The goal was not just to meet the assignment's requirements but to build a robust, user-friendly, and extensible tool that reflects professional software engineering practices.

## **1\. Core Philosophy: Beyond the Minimum**

The guiding principle was to address the core request—"determine what open-sourced models can the machine run and with what approximate latency (tpm)"—through the lens of a complete, end-to-end workflow. This meant considering not only how to *generate* the data but also how to *configure* the tests, *monitor* them in real-time, and *analyze* the results effectively.

This led to the development of a multi-faceted suite rather than a single script.

## **2\. Architectural Decisions**

The project was deliberately structured into a modular and decoupled system.

### **a. Unified Entry Point (main.py)**

Instead of creating separate, standalone scripts that the user would have to run individually, a single controller (main.py) was implemented.

* **Rationale**: This provides a clean, professional Command-Line Interface (CLI). It simplifies the user experience, centralizes argument parsing, and makes the entire suite feel like a single, cohesive application. It also makes the tool easier to extend with new modes in the future.

### **b. Decoupled Logic Modules**

The core functionalities were separated into distinct, importable modules:

1. batch\_benchmark.py: Handles the logic for systematic, config-driven testing.  
2. realtime\_benchmark.py: Contains the logic for the live, interactive terminal dashboard.  
3. interface.py: A completely separate web application for data visualization.  
* **Rationale**: This separation of concerns is a fundamental software engineering principle. It makes the code easier to maintain, debug, and test. For instance, changes to the Streamlit dashboard have no risk of breaking the data generation logic.

### **c. Configuration-Driven Approach**

The batch benchmarking mode is driven by an external JSON file (benchmark\_config\_grid.json) rather than hardcoded parameters.

* **Rationale**: This was a critical decision for flexibility and reproducibility. A user can define, save, and share complex test matrices without ever touching the Python code. It allows for easy A/B testing (e.g., comparing two models by simply changing a path in the JSON) and ensures that benchmark runs are easily repeatable.

## **3\. Technical Implementation Details**

### **a. Choice of Performance Metrics**

The assignment specified **TPM (Tokens per Minute)** as a key metric. However, to provide a more holistic performance profile, the following were also included:

* **Tokens per Second (TPS)**: The most standard measure of generation throughput.  
* **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: A critical latency metric that measures how quickly a model can start responding.  
* **Peak RAM & VRAM Usage**: Essential for determining the practical viability of running a model on specific hardware.  
* **Model Load Time**: Separated from TTFT to distinguish between initial setup cost and prompt processing speed.  
* **Rationale**: A model can have high TPS but also a high TTFT, making it feel slow in interactive use cases. Likewise, a fast model is useless if it consumes more RAM/VRAM than the host machine has available. This suite of metrics provides a complete picture.

### **b. Efficiency and Accuracy**

* **Efficient Test Execution**: The batch script was optimized to group tests by (model\_path, context\_size, ngl). This ensures that a model is only loaded into memory once for all tests that share these core parameters, drastically reducing redundant computation and speeding up the overall benchmark run.  
* **Reliable Results**: Each test scenario is run multiple times (TRIALS \= 2), and the results are averaged. This mitigates the impact of temporary system fluctuations and provides a more stable and reliable performance measurement.

### **c. Focus on User Experience (UX)**

A deliberate effort was made to ensure the tools are easy and pleasant to use.

* **rich for Real-time Monitoring**: The rich library was chosen for the real-time dashboard to provide a clean, visually appealing, and information-dense terminal UI that updates live without flickering.  
* **tqdm for Progress Bars**: The batch script uses tqdm to give the user a clear and accurate sense of progress during long-running test suites.  
* **streamlit for Visualization**: Instead of just outputting a CSV and expecting the user to analyze it in a separate program, a full-fledged interactive dashboard was built. This lowers the barrier to entry for data analysis and makes it easy to derive insights from the results.

## **4\. Conclusion**

Every decision, from the high-level architecture to the choice of specific libraries, was made to build a tool that is not only functional but also robust, flexible, and user-friendly. The resulting suite successfully answers the core question of the assignment and provides a professional-grade framework for local LLM performance analysis.
