Write a detailed article explaining the evolution of open-source large language models (LLMs) from GPT-2 to the present. Cover major milestones including LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral, Gemma, and Qwen. Highlight breakthroughs in efficiency, quantization formats like GGUF, improvements in training datasets, context length extensions, and advancements in inference tooling like llama.cpp. Also discuss the growing interest in on-device models and how hardware bottlenecks (like VRAM and RAM) influence model design and user adoption. Include practical use cases and implications for developers running models locally.
